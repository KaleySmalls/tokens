# Understanding ERC20 and ERC721 Tokens

In the world of Ethereum, tokens represent a vast array of digital assets. Two of the most prominent standards for these tokens are ERC20 and ERC721. Below, we'll explore the key characteristics and differences between these two types of tokens.

## ERC20 Tokens

ERC20 is a standard for fungible tokens, which means that each token is identical to every other token. It's similar to how traditional currencies work; for example, one dollar is always equal to another dollar. This fungibility makes ERC20 tokens ideal for use as currencies or shares.

### Key Features of ERC20

- **Fungibility:** Each token is identical to another, making them interchangeable.
- **Divisibility:** Tokens can be divided into smaller units, down to 18 decimal places.
- **Uniformity:** All ERC20 tokens follow the same set of rules (i.e., the ERC20 standard).
- **Wide Adoption:** ERC20 is the most commonly used token standard for ICOs and token sales.

### Common ERC20 Functions

- `totalSupply()`: Returns the total token supply.
- `balanceOf(address account)`: Returns the number of tokens that the account has.
- `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers a number of tokens directly to the recipient.
- `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Allows the spender to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the amount specified.
- `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers a number of tokens from the sender to the recipient.
- `allowance(address owner, address spender)`: Returns the remaining number of tokens that the spender will be allowed to spend on behalf of the owner.

## ERC721 Tokens

ERC721, on the other hand, is a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This means that each token is unique and can represent different assets. They're often used for collectibles, artwork, and other items where each token has its own specific value and properties.

### Key Features of ERC721

- **Non-Fungibility:** Each token has unique properties and is not interchangeable with other tokens.
- **Ownership:** ERC721 tokens can represent ownership over digital or physical assets.
- **Uniqueness:** Each token can carry unique information or attributes.
- **Transferable:** These tokens can be bought, sold, or traded on various platforms.

### Common ERC721 Functions

- `balanceOf(address owner)`: Returns the number of NFTs owned by the owner.
- `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the owner of the NFT specified by the tokenId.
- `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Safely transfers the ownership of a given token ID to another address.
- `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Transfers the ownership of a given token ID to another address.
- `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows another address to transfer the given token ID.
- `getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the approved address for a single NFT.
- `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool _approved)`: Enables or disables approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's assets.
- `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`: Returns if the `operator` is allowed to manage all of the `owner`'s assets.

## Conclusion

ERC20 and ERC721 tokens serve different purposes within the Ethereum ecosystem. ERC20 tokens are perfect for creating cryptocurrencies, whereas ERC721 tokens are ideal for unique digital collectibles and assets. Understanding these standards is crucial for anyone looking to develop or interact with tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
